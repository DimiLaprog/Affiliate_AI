# Affiliate_AI
 Made a python program to automate content creation for TikTok Videos.


 # The Idea
 The idea behind creating this program comes from the desire to create affiliate marketing videos through tik tok. A video typically requires the following:
 1. Pictures & Video Content
 2. Writing a Script
 3. Doing a voiceover
 4. Editing and Rendering the Video
 5. Uploading the video with the proper description etc.

All of the above steps require intensive effort and are time consuming. In an attempt to alleviate these pain points, a program specifically producing marketing content for Book Promotion was created.

# How it works
Step 1: Activate the virtual environment where all the packages are in.

Step 2: Run the Program and Generate random philosophical Questions. The program then randomly chooses one of them to proceed.

Step 3: The Program searches for up to 3 books that best answer the philosophical Question Chosen. Then, it downloads their book covers and generates a script to describe the books and connect them to the initial question. After that, it generates the voiceover in mp3 format. Also, it generates tik tok hashtags that are appropriate for the voicover and the tik tok video to be made.

#### Note: The above steps are all automated. The following steps are yet to be automated.
Step 4: I used davinci resolve to edit and render the program with the content created along with mock videos from pexels.

Step 5: Used the tik tok hashtags generated along with the video from step 4 to schedule an upload to tik tok.

# Improvements

1. While extra effort was put into prompt generation, definitely more time spent would improve the final result.
2. Video automation and Upload is something that I believe is quite possible.
3. This program only focuses on book promotion. The big dream behind it would be an open-source program that re-prompts user input to generate any type of content imaginable.

#### Note: For the program to work you need API keys for OPEN AI, Google CSE, Google Books.
